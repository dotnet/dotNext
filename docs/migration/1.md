Migration from 1.x
====
2.x is mostly compatible with 1.x. However, there are several minor and major incompatible changes in API surface.

Minor changes:
1. `DotNext.IO` namespace and its classes moved from **DotNext** library to **DotNext.IO** library
1. Encoding and decoding context from `DotNext.Text` namespace moved to **DotNext.IO** library
1. `DotNext.Runtime.InteropServices.Memory` class merged with `DotNext.Runtime.Intrinsics`
1. Core interfaces from `DotNext.Net.Cluster.Replication` namespace moved to **DotNext.IO** library
1. `DotNext.Net.Cluster.Consensus.Raft.PersistentState` class from `DotNext.Net.Cluster` class now completely migrated to `ValueTask` instead of `Task`

Major changes:
1. **DotNext.AspNetCore.Cluster** now relies on .NET Core 3.1 SDK instead of .NET Standard 2.1. This was happened because ASP.NET Core 3.x dependencies are not available from NuGet and became a part of .NET Core SDK.
1. **DotNext.AspNetCore.Cluster** uses Generic Host Builder instead of Web Host Builder so configuration methods are changed. Examine [this](../features/cluster/aspnetcore.md) article for more info.
1. `DotNext.Runtime.InteropServices.UnmanagedMemory` and `DotNext.Runtime.InteropServices.UnmanagedMemory<T>` classes from **DotNext.Unsafe** library are no longer exist. Use [UnmanagedMemoryPool](xref:DotNext.Buffers.UnmanagedMemoryPool`1) class instead
1. `EnsureConsistencyAsync` method removed from `IAuditTrail` interface. Method with the same is added to `IPersistentState` interface but it has different semantics aimed to support _ClientQuery_ RPC according with [Chapter 6](https://github.com/ongardie/dissertation/blob/master/clients/cheatsheet.pdf) of dissertation
1. Default Raft implementation calls `InitializeAsync` method of audit trail to reconstruct the state machine at initialization time. This functionality was missed in 1.x version
1. `InMemoryAuditTrail` class is replaced by `ConsensusOnlyState` which is optimized for cases when you need consensus functionality only without replication of real data
1. `ForceReplicationAsync` method of `IReplicationCluster` class is introduced and included into Raft implementation and allows to organize _ClientQuery_ RPC according with [Chapter 6](https://github.com/ongardie/dissertation/blob/master/clients/cheatsheet.pdf) of dissertation
1. `IMessaheHandler` interface moved from **DotNext.AspNetCore.Cluster** library to **DotNext.Net.Cluster** library and renamed to `IInputChannel`.
